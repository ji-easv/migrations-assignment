For the state-based migrations, we considered several different tools to generate the migration differences. 

First, we tried to use Flyway, but then we discovered that the community edition does not support schema differences.
Then, we tried to use Liquibase, but we found that it was not easy to set up, and we had some issues with the documentation.

Finally, we decided to use Atlas Go, which took a little bit of time to set up, but it was the easiest to use in the end.
For overview of the commands used, please refer to the [atlas.md file.](./atlas.md). The `StateBasedMigrationsSQL` folder contains the desired
state of the database for each task, while the `StateBasedMigrationsSQL/ProposedChanges` folder contains the SQL scripts generated by Atlas Go.
